With placards reading <em>‘Stop the Sabotage!’</em> and <em>‘Save Dangote Refinery!’</em>, students and youth leaders marched in unity from Iyana Oworo BRT Terminal towards the Third Mainland Bridge on Wednesday, October 8th, 2025.</p><p>The Refinery represents hope for Nigeria’s self-sufficiency in energy production and industrial independence. It’s a cornerstone project that could end the country’s reliance on imported fuel, create thousands of jobs, and spark economic revival across Africa.</p><p>Speaking during the walk, the IYN Lagos Coordinator emphasized that <strong>the youth will not sit idle while vested interests threaten national development</strong>. The message was clear: <em>“NANS stands with Dangote Refinery. Stop the sabotage, support progress.”</em></p><p>This act of solidarity demonstrated the power of unity and the youth’s determination to protect Nigeria’s industrial revolution.</p>",
